`ember-cli-d3-shape` is a shim for D3 `4.x`, loaded from NPM as ES6 modules. It includes `d3-shape` and all version 4 modules in D3 `4.x`.

---

D3 Shape is a set of primitives for building complex data visualisations. Because
it depends on all the other components of D3, this package also provides all other
D3 `v4.0` packages (see below for a list). 

This addon is just a shim, if you're looking for a more high level visualisation addon,
check out [maximum-plaid](https://github.com/ivanvanderbyl/maximum-plaid).

Each package is importable as per the D3 documentation for each package. 
This also means that you don't need to import the entire `d3.js` build into your App if you
only need a function or two. For example, check out [d3-array](https://github.com/d3/d3-array) for
an extensive library of useful Array functions not natively found in Javascript.

Example usage:

```js
import { line } from 'd3-shape';
import { scaleOrdinal } from 'd3-scale';
import { extent } from 'd3-array';
```

_This addon will be updated when new releases are cut of these packages. 
Currently none of these are 1.0 stable, so some of your code might break by 
upgrading. It is recommended that you have solid tests in place._

## Installation & Usage

Install this like any other Ember Addon:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-d3-shape
```

Then import what you need from each module:

```js
import { curveCardinalOpen } from  'd3-shape';
import { select } from 'd3-selection';

export default Ember.Component.extend({
  didInsertElement() {
    this.plot = select(this.element.querySelector('svg'));
  },

  didRender() {
    // NOTE: Do things with the DOM after it has rendered.
    this.plot.append('rect').attr('fill', '#15CD72');
  }
});
```
